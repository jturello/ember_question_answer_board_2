# Question-answer-board

Epicodus Javascript week 3 code review - Ember

#### Description/requirements: Continue developing the Question and Answer message board application.


##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement at least one computed property. Ideas:
* Allow users to up-vote the answer they think is best, then sort answers by number of up-votes.
* Or display the number of answers each question has with a computed property.
##### Add a helper. Possible Ideas:
* Nicely-formatted timestamps on questions and/or answers,
* a formatting change or special icon for questions with no answers,
* or questions with large numbers of answers, * a formatting change or special icon for the answer with the most up-votes, etc.
##### Integrate a service. Possible Ideas:
* Allow users to create lists of favorite questions or answers to reference later.
